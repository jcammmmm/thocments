Types
=======================================
In welding you do not talk about techniques but you talk about _processes_, so this are not the _types_ of welding, these are the types of _processes_.
* Revestida (col)., MMA, stick welding
* TIG
* MIG

MMA
-------------------
Commonly referred to stick welding or _revestida/electrodo_ here in colombia, this technique is based on the [electric arc](wiki)
phenomena.

### Electric Arc
When you have a high voltage (electric differenctial potential) that it is separed by an insultor and due this high potential this insulator becames a conductor (electric breakdown) the space that allow the current movement from high potential to low potential is called electric arc.

Welding Machine specs
=======================================
If you buy your welding machine outside of trusted resellers it is easy to get scammed with fake machines.
Since there are several processes out there, there are specialized machines in each one of the process. However there are machines that are capable of perform two or three process, at the cost that this mult-process machines are not as goot as their dedicated counterparts.
One vendor located [here](coords) said me that since the welder were from a high quality it could do the same job at a lesser amperage when compared to an falsification machine, due to the IGBT count.
