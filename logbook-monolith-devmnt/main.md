# Day 1
Trying to figure out how to understand the system. Today and the past three days
I worked for about 10 hours each day trying to create an special product account.
Also, yesterday was the start of current sprint. No new assignment was provided
to me. I feel extranged because I feel that this is a motivation to finish my
contract here.
Yesterday I talked a lot with my manager. He tell me that a team member left 
out global team due to a lack of results.
