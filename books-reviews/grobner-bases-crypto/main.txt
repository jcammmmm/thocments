# Review of Book's Chapter: Gröbner Bases, Coding, and Cryptography
## Gröbner Bases, Coding, and Cryptography: a Guide to State-of-Art
This chapter introduces the book. As such comments about the main idea behind how Cryptography is seen from book's perspective. To undestand the main idea of this chapter it is convenient to understand the concepts of [Algebraic variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_variety) and [Polynomial ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring). Also the concept of [ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ring_theory)#Ideal_generated_by_a_set) is important here, since can be seen as something that preserves the good properties of a field.
The tale came from the author describing Shannong work describing that in the end
hard cryptography is made through hard problems to solve. For Shanon, to solve systems of polynomial equations over a field F is hard to solve. From here and following the wikipedia article, appears the concept of Algebraic varieties introduced previously, and after talking of polynomial rings it follows the idea of _rings_ since polynomials make a set that it is a ring.
Following this introduction, the author says that the heart of Gröbner Bases is the set of polynomials that appears in a finite field $$ F $$ when it is associated to its multidimensional form $$ F^n $$. This field can be thought as multiplicative set powers for every non-zero element.
