# Day 13
I do not know the real number, but again I'm the new in the office. I write this kind of post because I want to develop an easy to manage and to mantain publisher, and as everyone knows there will be documents that it is better to not publish in the current times. 
Since here I will write all my thoughts and my dayly activities, as if it was a some kind of diary, at the time of publication this text in 2024 should be marked as hidden from the public. 
I need to sound terrific or rare, but that will be one functionality of this system.
