### 4.3 Gersgorin Disc Theorem
Here the authors remember that find the eingen values of a matrix A, is the same thing that to find the the zeros of the characteristic polynomial of that matrix. Something that now is pretty beautiful. 
The problem here is when we are about to find the eignen values for a large scale matrix, here appears an interesting computational problem that can be solved with Gersgoring theorem.
The theorem basically says that the eing value it is located somewhere in a neighborhood of the union of the diagonal elements $ a_ii $ that are contained in the matrix $ A $.
