WSL Knowledge
===========================================================
> In this collection of documents you will find some technical details about how WSL works, the technology around it, how that component interacts with the underlying system and other details.

Networking
===========================================================
WSL has a NAT between itself and the host system. Since this is an isolated component its own communication (networking) interfaces are created. These interfaces are created virtually when you setup the WSL on your machine.
