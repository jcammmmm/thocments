### Generalities vs Instances
We begin this conversation by talking about this general problem:
_Pepe is 3 years older than Maria, Maria is x years old, What is
the age of Pepe?_
In order to solve this problem you must know beforehand the age 
of Maria, because this is a general statement of the problem.
An instance of this problem is when you provide an age to Maria.
For example:
_Pepe is 3 years older than Maria, Maria is 15 years old, What is
the age of Pepe?_
A Generality is a description that a takes the features of something
without a particular value. An instance is a description of something
but with particular values.  
For example, 
_Generality: Camilo's height is x and Camilas's height is y. 
 Who is more taller, Camilo or Camila?_
_Instance: Camilo's height is 180 and Camila's height is 170.
 Who is more taller, Camilo or Camila?_



_The subject 'X' has the feature 'a' with value 'n'
 The subject 'Y' also has the feature 'a' with value 'z' units more than 'n'
 What is the original value of n_

_The subject 'Maria' has the feature 'Age' with value 'n'
 The subject 'Y' also has the feature 'a' with value 'z' units more than 'n'
 What is the original value of n_



### Radix operator 
#### Power operator
This allows the student to see how to represent operators, without
a symbol.

### Operators vs Symbols
What it is?
- symbol
- input description
- output description

### Bafaf(æ) Operator
This operator introduces the posibility to have 2 or more outputs, contrary
to the usual way to teach where you have only one output.
But when you try to mix the output of Bafaf operator with the classic equals
operator, the student will found that is not possible to operate a two 
element object with an operator that only admits a one element objects.

For instansce, let be '=' the classic equal operator, that means that will accept only 
two numbers, and will output 'true' or 'false', and be 'æ' the bafaf 
operator:

1 æ 1 = 1 æ 2

From here the student will guess that the following expression is not possible,
since 2 1 = 3 2 is not possible to compare. Why? Because the '=' operator only 
compare one number.
In order to compare the outputs of the bafaf operator, the student must define
a new operator but defining a new output and input description, for example, 
let be '=' the equivalence opeartor where two pair numbers are equal if every
number on each side is in the oposite side. For example

0 æ 1 = 1 æ 0
0 1 = 0 1
