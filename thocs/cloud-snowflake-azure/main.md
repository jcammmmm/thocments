Cloud hands-on with SnowFlake and Azure
===========================================================
> In this guide I will describe what is SnowFlake and Azure, what you can do with both of them, how to get the free trial and how can you connect them.

SnowFlake, what is it?
===========================================================
SnowFlake is a database engine offered as a service, then you do not need any installation, just go to your web browser and work with it. Azure is infrastructure as a service, then the same story for them.
When you want to try out these solutions you must create an account and request a free trial of the services. Both will let you try the technology for 30 days and Azure also have the cut constraint of 200$ USD in selected resources.

Azure setup
---------------------------------
1. For Azure you need a credit card. I requested one to Nequi. The process was straightforward, I only spent 1$ USD in the issuing process.
2. I create a new email address _cieloazul.pastoverde at hotmail.com_.
3. Create an Azure account. Here you provide the previously created email address and the credit card details.
4. Provide your cellphone or other email account is need for mandatory multiauth.

SnowFlake setup

2. Confirm your email.
3. You got the free trial account
